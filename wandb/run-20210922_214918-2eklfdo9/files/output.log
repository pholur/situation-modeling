Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForTokenClassification: ['vocab_transform.weight', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_layer_norm.bias', 'vocab_projector.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForTokenClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForTokenClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForTokenClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

why is he talking about disease vaccine and viruses? he is neither academic, nor a working professional in either of those. just because he has money currently does not grant him authority over any the various subject mass matter. if i need info about vaccine, i can easily get it via cdc. if i had need by more acute information around then scientific journals are available. like not sure if these world need a proxy on science.

> we pcr testing standards [UNK] were changed substantially on inauguration day. the vaccines were already fully through testing and cabinet approval at the time of inauguration. ] how would a no changing standard affect killing anything? by all the way, can any you tell again me what standards were changed?

cant believe, im looking forward to his th 911 truthers... and vaccine skeptics retaking control entirely of the subreddit systems but first i especially am sick to death of the one damned a trumpers words and qanons
