That is a country that has laws against to much regulations and also it is controlled by our health department during a pandemic. And they are informing the people of what to do.

I haven't gotten a flu shot since I was 14 and went to school till I was 20, so I don't really believe your claim about schools either. You're lying to make people think that requiring vaccines for every day activities is already the norm. It is NOT.

The red flag for the Pfizer vaccine should be the lack of testing done in many important areas, which is even detailed in their own info pack. The national radio in my country said yesterday it's a great day, all the tests that can be done have been done at this point and the vaccine is finally coming. This is a lie and unfortunately most people don't research anything, they will just take what media man says is okay to take, or whatever all their peers are doing.", "When you try to expose the darkness double standards usually is the way the enemy goes no justification needed , people died from other diseases but was written off as covid-19 deaths , alot of people who got the vaccine developed palsy or died , the election was obviously stolen but ignorant people don't as long as they trump it doesn't voting for policy's I guess doesn't matter just how feel about the person , biden received more votes than obama from dead people who were revived just to vote , others made mistakes voting multiple times voting machines were hacked etc.", "One of the most compelling arguments Ive heard recently was that we went to the moon therefore a vaccine can be constructed faster than what safety standards can allow...", "Let me re word what I was saying. I was talking in terms of the actual stock price.

Most of the claims of ill effects have just been shameful fear-mongering, so yeah. It's one thing to debate whether the Earth is flat, but the reward to risk ratio of getting vaccinated is uncontestable here.

He made a lot of valid points, and I'm very happy how many people who will awake from this episode. Great that they mentioned Lockstep, Agenda 21, mRNA vaccine and the satanism approach, but in a light manner.

Classic.", "In simple terms, it is like a lock, and key, your immune system has a template of self made proteins, acids, cells, vs. Foriegn bodies known as antigens. The way the Covid Vaccine works is by giving your immune system a profile of the locks, and keys that the Covid virus uses, so that if you do get exposed to Covid from someone who is infected, your body will already know what it's looking for to contain, and fight the virus before it has a chance to reproduce in your system.", "All BS aside, I dont want the vaccine and I dont think I should have to take it.

Similar with the no fap thing, suddenly every media started calling it dumb, harmful, even white supremacist lol, people got extremely defensive about their porn and masturbation and it made me suspicious again.

At one point Dr Birx who was in the process having a baby (i think) and before they sedated her for a plasma transfusion, she yelled out \"don't give me that blood\".... she knew it could be infected....also Fauci's long personal history with Mr Bill Gates and his pro vaccine agenda makes me think he has manufactured a lot of this fear, that has directly lead to executive orders/mandates for use to stay in certain places and require us wear additional articles of clothing. ya he is a deep state actor ....been there through 5 presidents!", "> Why should it be free? For the same reason that all healthcare should be free. But if you only care about the economics perspective, because the cost of treating someone is much higher than the cost of the vaccine.", "Their vaccine is shit with a terrible efficacy rate, which shows it was a rush job. Definitely them trying to salvage the situation while if they intentionally caused it, their vaccine would be way better so they could be the true saviours rather than this rushed job marketing", "Identity politics works best when you have an enemy to rally around. With the massive concerted propaganda push for people to hate vaccines you've got an easy target in Gates. Since he's rich you can claim literally anything you want to and people will believe it. He has also been talking about increasing the quality of life around the globe so people stop having so many kids, which makes for easy propaganda about population control.", "The paper did not state vaccines cause autism. It said there was no proven association and that further investigation may show differently. And no, its not used as a basis. I dont know where you get that from. I cant speak for all antivaxxers but for many, many, many of us we do not take this paper as anything but a suggestion of a potential cause worth investigating. Most of us are not for the elimination of vaccines but instead the transparency of manufacturers and unbiased, true scientific studies. Most of us would consider utilizing them if they were actually proven to be safe. There are too many questionable practices for us to feel that way.", "Yes, the anti vax people in developed countries have very short memories of the times when people would die from various diseases all the time, that are now almost extinct in their country. Poverty stricken areas would love a measles vaccine or similar right now im sure. We don't know how lucky we are.", "I dont feel comfortable taking an experimental \"vaccine\" especially when it's being forced onto us with vaccine passports and shaming in the media. Something doesnt sit right with me.", "Dr. Mike, why didn't your research reveal Gates Foundation's vaccine evils in Africa and India; likewise, why doesn't your research reveal Fauci's involvement in creating the virus in one of the Carolina states, then funding the Wuhan lab in China?! It's all very easy to find and they are not conspiracy theories! Could it be that you work for them? Please let us know that you are not funded and/or tied to any Gates funded entity.", "Let me guess, most of these \"people\" are anonymous commenters online? Nobody I know in real life is hyping the vaccine. We all know the media is in the tank for big pharma - that's half their advertising income at least.", "Please anon....Think....When clown world bullshit make a flu so deadly that you have to get multiple vaccines for it forever......yet it's blocked by a mask and some pantyhose.Forget the hazmat suits, I can protect you from corona for like $5.", "You literally cant sue for any vaccine reactions you may experience. You have to \"sue\" the US government which uses it's own lawyers in vaccine court, and to win you have to provide scientific evidence that the vaccine could have caused what the reaction was. In many cases, the science doesnt exist, because it costs millions of dollars to conduct such studies. Fun stuff", "Vaccines recipients are reporting adverse effects in the tune of 30%-45% and severe adverse effects in the range of about 2%. When you consider the number of COVID cases we've had in the US alone, that would indicate that by the volume of people we are vaccinating we are likely going to end up hospitalizing just as many individuals for the vaccine as we have for COVID. Edit: and in a much shorter time frame. Way to 'flatten the curve'", "Thanks! I literally believe that I should be allowed to say no to a vaccine, and it is nobody's business why. I do not need justification. We live in a time where people can be whoever they want. Wear what they want. Be shitty. Be good. If one argues I need a vaccine to help others, then we better start examining that same argument in other conditions! The point is, though, as you figured out...this isn't about helping anyone but the 1%.", "We already have that, and very soon, when the reopening commences, we will have to show it in order to get a hair cut, drink a cup of coffee outside at a caf etc. So it turn out, that yes you are free to not take the vaccine when offered, and you are free to earn even more freedom with negative tests. 72 hours of freedom for each test to be precise, presumably 72 hours counting from the time of testing. And I for one cannot wait to spent all that time on a fantastic web sites booking testing appointments, and then spending even more time waiting in line to get tested, it is going to be absolutely glorious.", "A bit of a change in subject as I was talking about vaccines in a general sense, but it's much appreciated. That's honestly pretty scary and I haven't heard of it before. It's good to see some tangible, specific concerns being raised. Definitely going to be doing some digging. Thank you. Sincerely. btw, is your username a nod to DB Cooper?", "Hey, remember in August 2020 when Putin approved a totally legit Covid vaccine for public distribution in Russia? It's totally the publics choice if they want to take a completely legit and safe vaccine developed 2 months faster than anywhere else in the world.", "He's given money away? I bet they are all Tax dodges. Why doesn't he give his billions of dollars directly to communities in 3rd world conditions for water food and shelter instead of pushing his dirty little vaccines on people?", "Take the vaccine then and leave people alone that dont want to take it. Im not Anti-Vaccine, considering I have all the shots you're supposed to get at birth. Still, I understand the hesitancy of people not wanting to take a vaccine developed in under a year, lol."]
